<h3>Directions</h3>

<!-- Step-by-step instructions -->
<p>
  <b>Step 1</b><br />
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch cake tin
  with cooking spray and line with parchment paper.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Step 2</b><br />
  Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt together in a large
  bowl. Add eggs, milk, and vegetable oil; mix by hand or beat with an electric
  mixer on low speed until smooth. Add more flour if batter is too runny. Pour
  into the prepared pan.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Step 3</b><br />
  Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the
  cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a
  table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert cake carefully onto a cooling
  rack. Let cool completely.
