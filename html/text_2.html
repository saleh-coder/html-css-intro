<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">
  Linux (/ˈlɪnʊks/, LIN-uuks)[15] is a family of open-source Unix-like operating
  systems based on the Linux kernel,[16] an operating system kernel first
  released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.[17][18][19] Linux is
  typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes the kernel
  and supporting system software and libraries — many of which are provided by
  the GNU Project — to create a complete operating system.

  Socrates, one of the most influential philosophers in history, is known for
  his statement <q>All I know is that I know nothing</q>. This phrase is a
  reminder that true wisdom comes from understanding our own limits and being
  open-minded about our intellectual shortcomings
