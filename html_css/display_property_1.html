<!-- 
 Explanatory Comments:
 div: The <div> element is by default a block-level element,
 meaning it takes up the entire available width and starts on a 
 new line.
 
 span: The <span> element is by default an inline element, which
 means it does not properly respect the top and bottom margins.
 By using display: inline-block, the <span> element behaves like a 
 block, allowing the correct use of vertical margins (top and bottom).
 This is particularly useful when you want to apply vertical spacing, 
 something that wouldn't work properly with a regular inline <span>.
