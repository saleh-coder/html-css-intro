<!-- 

Explanation of Changes:

 div (display: flex): By using display: flex on the parent <div>, the
 child <span> elements are placed in a row without the unwanted space
 that typically occurs when using display: inline-block. This solves
 the issue of extra spacing between the elements.

 span (display: inline-block): The span elements are given inline-block
 behavior so they retain their inline characteristics but can now 
 respect the margin and padding correctly when placed inside a flex 
 container.

 margin and padding: With margin: 5px and padding: 5px applied, you can
 see the exact margin between the spans (5px), and it will behave as 
 expected without any additional space in between.

 This is one of the possible solutions for handling the unwanted space
 between inline-block elements.
